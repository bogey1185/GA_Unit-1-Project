 5. Farkle5: Player 2 hits roll button. ROlls a 1 which is worth 100 points.
 6. Farkle6: Player moves first die to second row, reserving the 100 points it represents. Curr score is now showing 100. Player 2 hits roll again, which rolls the remaining 5 dice.
 7. Farkle7: Player 2 has rolled three of a kind 3's, which is worth face value times 100 (300 points). Player 2 reserves them into top and curr score is now 400.
 8. Farkle8: player 2 has 400 points accumulated. Player 2 may risk it and roll the remaining two dice. Instead, player 2 plays it safe and hits end turn button. The 400 poitns are added to player 2's scoreboard in top right. Player 2 could have hit roll again instead. If, for example, he got no scores, he would have farkled, and lost the 400. If he got two 1's, though, his curr score would have become 600, the top row of dice would have cleared, and he would be able to rolll with 6 new dice. This process continues until he gets a farkle or his end turn button.
